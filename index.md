for new meetings in the fall.**

What:
-----

A monthly meetup of researchers, scientists, and engineers who are always
learning new tips and tricks to make their computational and data work flows
better. Topics will be focused around scientific computing and data
technologies. We call it "The Hacker Within" because we believe that everyone
can find their inner computational skills. In these friendly sessions, peers at
all levels of experience share topics useful to our work.

This meeting would be a great venue for introducing new libraries, showing off
useful features of a scientific library or programming language you're using,
bringing up a computational problem you're having, or demonstrating an
analyses.

Who:
-----

Anyone interested in software development best practices is welcome to come to
our meetings.

Where:
-----

Data Science Initiative Classroom       
Third Floor Shields Library, Rm 360      
UC Davis

When:
-----

The second Thursday of the month at at 5:10pm. While the main talk should
occupy less than an hour, the lightning talks and hacking session can go on
until 7:00pm or later. See the [upcoming topics list]({{ site.url
}}/upcoming.html) for the topic for this week.

How:
-----

Participating is really easy.

- At **5:10pm**, we gather and go through a round of introductions. New faces
  are always appearing!
- Next, a volunteer will give a **tutorial** or lead a **discussion** about a
  computational topic. This topic can be anything useful, new, or interesting
  to those who compute. It may be some new skill you have recently picked up in
  your research, a productivity tool you have recently learned to love, an
  overview of a useful library, or anything you feel we would enjoy
  learning.
- Finally, there will be a time for a handful of **[Lightning
  Talks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk)**, which are 5 minute
  blasts of information about a particular topic or question of interest to the
  group. **Note** that the lightning talk time is a good way to bring a
  question to the group. If you have a bug you need help with, here's the place
  to ask many ears about it at once.

The Hacker Within relies on peer-driven teaching, so please volunteer to give
one of these talks. To do so, just ping the listhost by email at
[thehackerwithin@ucdavis.edu](mailto:thehackerwithin@ucdavis.edu). You will
need to subscribe to the list first at
[lists.ucdavis.edu](https://lists.ucdavis.edu/sympa/info/thehackerwithin).

Why:
----

The tenets of scientiÔ¨Åc endeavor (e.g., data control, reproducibility,
comprehensive documentation, and peer review) suffer in projects that fail to
make use of current software development tools such as unit testing, version
control, automated documentation, data managements, etc.

To avoid these pitfalls, this weekly meeting exists for sharing skills and best
practices for computational scientific applications. This group is modeled
after The Hacker Within, which  began as a student organization at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison and is now reborn as a collection of such
chapters around the world. Each of the chapters convenes a community of
scientists, at all levels of their education and training, to share their
knowledge and best practices in using computing to accomplish their work.

Support:
--------

The Hacker Within is supported by the [UCD Data Science
Initiative](http://datascience.ucdavis.edu/).
